My drawing "Pink Planet" was selected for the Themeless show on exhibit at the [Rosebud Gallery](https://www.rosebudgallery.com/) in San Francisco from August 7 until August 30 2025.

Cabure Bonugli, the curator at Rosebud, is an amazing supporter of the queer art community. I'm honored to have my art hang amongst the incredible work in this show.
