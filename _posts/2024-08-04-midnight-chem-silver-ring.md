![cartoon turtle wearing red and yellow scarf](../_images/silver_ring.jpeg)The first story of my collection of fairytales in-progress has found a home!
[The Silver Ring](https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2/the-silver-ring), a retelling of "The Man Who Came Out Only at Night" is available online in [Midnight Chem Issue Two](https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2)! 

Thank you to Timothy Cech and his collaborators at [Midnight Chem](https://www.midnightchem.org/) for ushering my work into the world.
