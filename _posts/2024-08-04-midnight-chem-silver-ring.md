  <td>The first story of my collection of fairytales in-progress has found a home!

  <a href="https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2/the-silver-ring">The Silver Ring</a>, a retelling of "The Man Who Came Out Only at Night" is available online in <a href="https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2">Midnight Chem Issue Two</a>! 

Thank you to Timothy Cech and his collaborators at <a href="https://www.midnightchem.org/">Midnight Chem</a> for ushering my work into the world.
