I'm honored to announce that my story, [The Giraffe](https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2/the-silver-ring), is available in issue 31 of [Your Impossible Voice](https://www.yourimpossiblevoice.com/)!

Based upon Apple Girl from Calvino's "Italian Folk Tales," my version takes a decidedly queer twist.

A million thanks to Keith Powell, Stephen Beachy, and all the fine folk at [Your Impossible Voice](https://www.yourimpossiblevoice.com/) for selecting and sharing my work!
