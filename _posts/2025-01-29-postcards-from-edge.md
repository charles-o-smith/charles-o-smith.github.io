title:  'Postcards from the Edge 2025'
---
Sometime in June of 2024 during my year of drawing robots, I got on a "The robots made me gay" kick. 
When [Visual Aids](https://postcards.visualaids.org/) put out the call for submissios to [Postcards from the Edge](https://postcards.visualaids.org/), I knew I wanted to send some robotic love.
Thanks to this all-inclusive project, I can now say that my art has shown in a gallery in New York city.

![My postcard from the edge: a grinning robot with a boom box body and incandescent bulb ears dances in high-top sneakers and knee-high striped sweatsocks. They assert, "The robots made me gay!"](/images/trmmg.jpeg)

I wish I'd got to see it hanging on the wall surrounded by its neigbors, but alas, they take the works down as soon as folks show up to buy them.
This is the collector, collecting my piece...
