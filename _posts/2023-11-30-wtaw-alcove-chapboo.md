Today [WTAW Press](https://www.wtawpress.org/) named the winner of their Alcove Press Chapbook Series contest. I am honored that my story "The Long Rising Loaf" was named a finalist.

The story is based primarily on the first half the Palestinian Arabic folk tale "The Seven Leavenings" with an American tale "The Height of Purple Passion" mixed in. I came across both stories in the 2005 Virago Press edition of _Angela Carter's Book of Fairy Tales_, but more about that in another post or essay.
