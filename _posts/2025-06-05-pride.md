I have a mixed media collage, "Queer Joy is Resistance," in the Queer Ass Pride show on exhibit at the [Rosebud Gallery](https://www.rosebudgallery.com/) in San Francisco from June 5 until June 24 2025.

At a time when queer spaces are shrinking and the nationalist fervor is making us all anxious for our lives, it's great to see new spaces where we can feel safe. I have a piece in the show with 50-some odd other queer artists. If you're in SF this month, treat yourself to a visit.
