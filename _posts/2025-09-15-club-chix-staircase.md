I'm overflowing with delight to announce that my story, [The Staircase](https://clubchicxulub.com/club-chicxulub-journal-vol-4-limbo/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-15), is available in [Club Chicxulub](https://clubchicxulub.com/club-chicxulub-journal-vol-4-limbo/) Vol 4.: "Limbo" !

About "The Staircase," editor Lauren C. Johnson says:
> Reading this story taught me about my own sense of literary aesthetics because I realized how much I like tight, claustrophobic settings...and I love how this story follows a circular structure, kinda like a winding staircase!

I am deeply grateful to Lauren and her co-editor Matt Carney for including my work!
This issue is overflowing with fantastic stories, art (the cover is stunning!), and narrations with musical accompaniment.
