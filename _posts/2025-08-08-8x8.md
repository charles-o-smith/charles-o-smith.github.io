One of my "The robots made me gay" drawings was selected for the 8x8 show on exhibit at the [Tamper Room](https://www.instagram.com/tamperroom/) in Fremont during the month of August.

All the art in the show had to be precisely 8 inches by 8 inches. I work on 8"x8" watercolor paper, so I mounted my drawing on on a wooden panel of the same size. It was cool to experiment with wax medium to seal the peice and go through the mounting process.

I encourage you to support this fantastic cafe in the South Bay and check out their art exhibitions. It's a great space.

Other images include a crazed cat tangled in string, fantastical flowers and musrooms, a cozy tea-room interior with a cat in the window, two otters frolicking in the water, and a doll house interior.](/images/8x8.jpeg)
