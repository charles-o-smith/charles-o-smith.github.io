One of my "The robots made me gay" drawings was selected for the Group Therapy show on exhibit at the [Rosebud Gallery](https://www.rosebudgallery.com/) in San Francisco from May 1 until May 24 2025.

The show is based around the themes of mental health, addiction, growth, grief, pain, & trauma in art.
Now more than ever we must be vocal to destigmatize mental health issues while the Trump regime and RFK Jr. work to undermine and destroy frameworks of mentail health support that make life livable for so many Americans.

It is an honor to be inclded in this show with other fantastic artists. I've participated in several group shows and invitationals before, but this marks the first time I've had the delight of seeing my art hanging in a gallery in person.
