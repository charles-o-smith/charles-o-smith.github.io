title:  "The Giraffe nominated for a Pushcart Prize"
---
Several years ago I sought the help of a friend to work through my difficulty finishing the writing project I was (not) working on at the time.
As part of one exercise, I visualized a steep mountain path lined with torii gates.
My future "author" self stood at the summit looking down at my then-present self languishing near the base.

I had no idea how the one would eventually become the other.

On December 2nd, when the editors of [Your Impossible Voice](https://www.yourimpossiblevoice.com/) annouced the nomination my fairy tale [The Giraffe](https://www.yourimpossiblevoice.com/the-giraffe/) for a [Pushcart Prize](http://www.pushcartprize.com/), I immediately recalled the image of the two writers at opposite ends of the mountain path.
This nomination is obviously a torii gate.
The publication of "The Giraffe" and "The Silver Ring" from my collection in progress were also gates, though I didn't realize it at the time.

Reflecting now, there have been thousands of gates: simply sitting down to write, drawing spirals for ten minutes, taking classes and workshops, showing up to my mindful writing group, reading folk tales and rewriting them in my journal, seeking community to help illuminate my path, and countless more.
Not all gates feel monumentual when you pass.

Now, even though infinite gates may remain, the metaphor feels more welcoming than daunting; the role of patience more clear.

I am grateful to Keith Powell and Stephen Beachy for their support of my work and to everyone who has helped me on my journey thus far.
