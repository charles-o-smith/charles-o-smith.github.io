title:  '2024: A year in reading "wrapped"'
---
The days are short and the nights are dark. Spotify is busy reminding everyone of their listening habits. I read so many wond

Here are the highlights of my reading life this year:

### [Fantasy Kit](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781625570376) by Adam McOmber
This one makes the list since I finished it on Jannuary 5th. For me, the story "Mars 1887" truly put the "fantasy" in the "Fantasy Kit".
Beautifully written, sexy, speculative, scary. Left me wanting more of McOmber's work.

### [Vulgarian Rhapsody](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781953103383) by Alvin Orloff
A sassy snark-filled romp through end-of-millenium SF.
I imagined the narrator as Armistead Maupin’s bitter, self-indulgent doppelgänger.
The nested fairy tale "Dougie Doodles and the Enchanged Gay Bar" melted my fabulist's heart.

### [Hurricane Season](https://bookshop.org/p/books/hurricane-season/18888412?ean=9780811230735) by Fernanda Melchor

Because it is rife with sexual violence, this book is not everyone. Horrific. Heartbreaking. Brilliantly told. 
What appears at first to be a rambling style, steadily comes together in intricately woven layers.
This book inspired much debate with a good friend about queer voices, authorship, and Mexican literature.

### [Metamorphica](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781250215000) by Zachary Mason

I probably need to read this book again. For the majority of the time I was comparing it to Mason's previous work "The Lost Books of the Oddysey," a book I loved.
The final story "Epistolary," about Ovid writing a letter to Augustus and sending it with a courier, brought everything together in the most satisfying way.

### [Fifty Beasts to Break Your Heart: And Other Stories](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9780593314180) by Gennarose Nethercott

My favorite stories in this fine collection were the first and the last. IMHO, “Sundown at the Eternal Staircase” is an instant classic.

### [Island Rule: Stories](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781982122201) by Katie M. Flynn

This collection is a deliciously strange cycle of stories that fit together like a puzzle box.
While reading one story you'll glimpse a character from another in a different context.
The same thing happens with events and objects that emerge and reemerge in various settings and plots.
Meanwhile, the menace of ecological disaster looms extremely large.

### [The Book of Love](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9780812996586) by Kelly Link

Believe the hype. This is a fantastic book.

### [Dont Try This at Home](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781908276520)

"When We Were Witches" stood out as my favorite tale in this solid collection.

### [Pricksongs and Descants: Fictions](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9780802136671) by Robert Coover

I love Coover's writing, especially "The Grand Hotels (of Joseph Cornell)". I reread Pricksongs and Descants for the first time since my postmodern fiction class in college.
It is great collection--sly, adept, brimming with stylistic technique; There's a reason that it's a classic.
But there is something creepy, perhaps intentionally, about the way Coover splays open (manspreads?) the straight male gaze in these stories that leaves me wanting a shower.

### [Storyeater](https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2/storyeater) by Daniel Alexander

This "door 1" in [Midnight Chem issue two](https://www.midnightchem.org/no-2) begins at the end.
It's the story of Fletch, a hero who can't let go after her death. Speculative. Meta. Wonderful.

### [Her Body and Other Parties: Stories](https://bookshop.org/a/100115/9781555977887)
