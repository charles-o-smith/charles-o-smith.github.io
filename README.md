# 2023.05.10 Welcome

Howdy, I'm Charles. You may have stumbled across my site because you heard I'm working on a collection of fairytales.

This site is nascent / a work in progress. Please pardon my fairy dust.

But mainly I needed a place to put my story [Where Do the Dead Go When the Living Come to Town](wdtdg.md) since the website for Samizdat Literary Journal is no longer active.
