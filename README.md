My friend [Daniel Mandel](https://www.danielrmandel.com/) has interviewed me for his Creative Engagement podcast. In my episode, I read an excerpt called "The Tower" from a novel in progress and we talk about fairytales and crativity. You can hear the podcast:

Howdy, I'm Charles. You may have stumbled across my site because you heard I'm working on a collection of fairytales.

This site is nascent / a work in progress. Please pardon my fairy dust.

But mainly I needed a place to put my story [Where Do the Dead Go When the Living Come to Town](wdtdg.md) since the website for Samizdat Literary Journal is, sadly, no longer active.
